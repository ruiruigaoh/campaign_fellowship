# Maximizing success in a historical political race: data-driven digital marketing and canvassing

Since January 2024, I have been leveraging my analytical and technical skills by working as a data analyst on a local grassroots political campaign in Queens, NY to support its success leading up to the June 2024 Democratic primary election. The candidate, [Judge Wendy Li](https://www.voteforwendyli.com/), is running in a competitive election for the position of Surrogate's Court Judge in Queens. Her win would be historic and represent the first time a woman and minority occupied this seat in New York. 

The scope of the project can be divided into two main objectives:

1) **Enhance the campaign's outreach strategies** by predicting and segmenting voter lists based on demographic factors (race, political party, voting history) to enable the marketing team to implement targeted messaging strategies. 

2) Develop a **data-driven canvassing strategy** to optimize signature collection efforts by assigning volunteers to petition in areas of Queens with high target voter density.
