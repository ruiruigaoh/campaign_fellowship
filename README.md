# Maximizing success in a historical political race: data-driven digital marketing and canvassing

Starting in January 2024, I have been leveraging my analytical and technical skills as a data analyst to bolster the success of a local grassroots political campaign leading up to the June 2024 Democratic primary in Queens, NY. The candidate, Judge Wendy Li, is running in a competitive election for the position of Surrogate's Court Judge in Queens. Her win would be historic and represent the first time a woman and minority occupied this seat in New York. 

The scope of the project can be broken down into two main objectives:

1) Enhance the campaign's outreach strategies by predicting and segmenting voter lists based on demographic factors (race, political party, voting history) to enable the marketing team to implement targeted messaging strategies. 

2) Develop a data-driven canvassing strategy to optimize door-knocking petition and signature collection efforts by identifying geographic areas of Queens with high target voter density.
